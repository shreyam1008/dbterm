#
# HOW TO UPDATE THIS FILE:
# 1) Add a new entry as the FIRST non-comment line (top of this list).
# 2) Format for each entry:
#      <version>|<release name>|<short description>
# 3) Version must be SemVer without "v" (example: 0.3.4).
# 4) Commit and push to main.
#    The release workflow reads only the first non-comment line and creates that GitHub release.
# 5) If that tag already exists, the workflow fails (prevents duplicate releases).
#
# Newest entry first:
0.3.3|Production Installer Rollout|Cross-platform one-command installer flow, Windows ARM64 artifacts, shortcut/help sync, and direct dbterm uninstall support.
